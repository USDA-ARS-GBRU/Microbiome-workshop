# Goals
One goal of this workshop is to build a community of ARS researchers doing
microbiome work. We have a series of discussions sessions that are designed
to give you time to discuss your work and things that could be done and foster
 a community of practice.

Session on is focused on what you are going and what you need from a community.
We have provided guiding questions but feel free to discuss other needs or areas.

* What kinds of microbiome work have you done and what challenges did you face?
* If you have not done microbiome work what are you thinking of doing and are
there obstacles to starting?
* Are there specific resources that could have helped you?
* Do you need access to sequencing or sequencing expertise?
* Do you need access to computational resources compute time, storage, high
memory machines?
* Do you need better access to people with scripting or programming experience?
* Do you need access for training in computational areas for you or your employees?
* Do you have the opportunity to work with other scientists on microbiome
projects currently?
* If you could have a partner for microbiome research they would...
* What would you like to get out of a community focused on microbiome research?
* What do your think you would contribute?
