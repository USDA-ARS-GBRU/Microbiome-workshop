As of August 10 we have official approval and can provide you with travel instructions.

The workshop will be from August 29-30 with travel days of the 28 and 31 if you need them.  We anticipate finishing by 17:00 on the 30th so departure that night should be possible for some of you. The workshop will be at the National Agricultural Library, please enter the building using the [main entrance](https://www.nal.usda.gov/visit-library).

Travel charges are being monitored by USDA and we have to report total expenses, so we would ask that you be prudent on your charges and extremely timely on turning in your travel vouchers.

Please have a copy of the travel authorization and voucher sent to Wendy Smith (<wendy.smith@ars.usda.gov>) with the subject line as “MWS and your name”.

You should have received an email from Brian Scheffler with the subject "Microbiome travel information" that contains the accounting code for your travel. Your travel arranger will need to put in a portal request to add this code to your profile for this trip.

Please book your room at the Holiday Inn - College Park which is within walking distance to NAL:
